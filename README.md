# TO-DO

This HTML document represents a simple To-Do List application. Here's a description of the code:

The document starts with standard HTML5 doctype declaration and sets the language to English.

Inside the <head> section:

Charset is set to UTF-8 for proper character encoding.
The viewport meta tag is used for responsive design.
Title of the page is set to "To-Do List".
Some basic CSS styling is embedded to style the to-do list items.
Inside the <body> section:

<h1> tag displays the title "My To-Do List".
An <input> field with type "text" and id "taskInput" allows users to input their tasks.
An <input> field with type "time" and id "timeInput" allows users to input the time associated with the task.
A <button> with id "addTaskBtn" is provided to add tasks to the list.
A <ul> with id "taskList" is used to display the list of tasks.
Inside the <script> tag:

JavaScript code is used to handle the functionality of the To-Do List.
It listens for the "DOMContentLoaded" event to ensure all DOM elements are loaded before executing the script.
It initializes variables for the task input, time input, add task button, and task list.
The addTask() function is defined to add a new task to the list.
The editTask() function is defined to allow users to edit tasks by clicking on them.
Event listeners are set up for clicking the "Add Task" button and pressing Enter in the task input field to add tasks.
When a task is added, it creates a new list item (<li>) containing the task text, time, and a delete button.
Clicking the delete button removes the task from the list.
Clicking on a task item allows the user to edit the task text and time.
Overall, this code creates a simple interactive To-Do List where users can add tasks, specify times, delete tasks, and edit existing tasks.
